# Cryptography Math Cohort Code Repository

This repository contains my implementations of mathematical concepts as part of the cryptography math cohort at [Web3Clubs](https://x.com/web3clubs). The cohort curriculum covers a broad range of mathematical topics, progressing from foundational concepts to advanced techniques used in Web3 development.

## üßë‚Äçüéì About the Cohort
The Web3Clubs cryptography math cohort is a journey through essential mathematics for cryptography and Web3 applications. Topics covered in the cohort include:

- **Number Theory and Cryptography**
- **Algebra and Linear Algebra**
- **Discrete Mathematics and Graph Theory**
- **Probability, Statistics, and Mathematical Modeling**
- **Abstract Algebra and Finite Fields**
- **Mathematics of Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), SNARKs, and STARKs**

The curriculum is designed to take participants from an introductory level to advanced concepts, providing the mathematical foundation needed for cryptography in the Web3 space.

## üìÇ Current Implementations
While I will only be pushing select implementations from the cohort, here are a couple of examples currently available in this repository:

### 1. **Prime Factorization**
An implementation in Rust to compute the prime factors of a given number.

### 2. **Euler's Totient Function**
A function that calculates the Euler phi of a number using its prime factors. This is a key concept in number theory and cryptography.

### 3. **File Hashing Using SHA-256**
An implementation to hash files using the SHA-256 algorithm, commonly used in cryptographic applications to ensure integrity and data security.

### 4. **Order of Direct Product Groups**
An exploration of the order of direct product groups, an important concept in abstract algebra and group theory.

### 5. **Scalar multiplication as used in Ethereum keypair generation**
An exploration of scalar multiplication using secp256k1 to generate Ethereum account public keys from randomly generated private keys
